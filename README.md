z-type-cracker
==============

This is a pretty dumb cracker I made for the Z-Type game by [@phoboslab](https://github.com/phoboslab) available [here](http://phoboslab.org/ztype/).

I also include a beautified version of the source code of the game, made possible with the help of [this](http://jsbeautifier.org/) online tool. It helped me understand what I needed to get this hack done.

I guess I must have a way of not having to create the ```FakeEvent``` object, but that's the only way I could make it work. If you have any ideas, fork it, open an issue, you name it!
